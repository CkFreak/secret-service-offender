# Secret Service Offender Chrome Extension
### The idea
The BND (German Secret Service) is monitoring data on one of Germany's biggest datapoints.
 German officials seem to be ok with this practice.
 I wanted to feel a little less useless for one afternoon and build this Chrome extension that you can use
 to add any header you like to your HTTP requests.
 I am personally adding a header called bnd with some text that maybe some day someone will read at the BND.
 
 I am aware that this is useless shit. Take it as such and have some fun...
 
 ### How to run it?
 You either go ahead and download it [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=13JyCZk-0u6Aj4WFX1qOhw_F-P1IeoYv3) or you can clone this repository and import the unpacked extension directly into Chrome.
 Unfortunately I do not own a credit card and as such I am unable to use the Chrome Webstore. 
 I apologize for your inconvenience!
 
 To add the extension open Chrome and then navigate to: Chrome://extensions
 Now simply drag and drop the .crx file into the browser to start the installation process.
 
 ### Bugs
 I am sure there are many. Feel free to open an issue with some steps to recreate the bug so I can fix it. 
 If you are really eager you are welcome to fix it yourself and make a pull request to this repo.
